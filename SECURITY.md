Thanks for helping make CYF safe for everyone.

## Security
CYF takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our CodeYourFuture organizations.

We are a small grassroots community of volunteers and do not run any kind of bug bounty programme. 

## Reporting Security Issues
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any CYF-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, please send an email to github-owners[@]codeyourfuture.io or if you are on our Slack, come to #cyf-devops

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
